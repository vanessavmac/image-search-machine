# image-search-machine

Under construction.

MERN project using the [Google Images API](https://serpapi.com/images-results). Users can enter a list of words and the application returns the top google image search results. Users can swap out images as needed and then download all the images at once, making the process of finding images for slide decks, graphics, and presentations more efficient.

In-Progress:
- User Analytics (e.g. track the number of times application is used)
- Implement google sign in so users can login and save their searches/image files

Future Features/Applications of the Project:
- While this project was initially created to help presentation makers gather quality images quickly, this project can also be repuposed to gether and label images to train an image classification model (connect python image classifier in the backend)
